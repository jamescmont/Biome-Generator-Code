D1: For my polymorphic interface I created BiomeCallback, which doesn’t do too much just a functional interface with the method onGrow and since MainStage has an instance of it which notifies when the biome is grown
D2: Most of my subclasses happens in the classes of Desert and Mountain, arounds line 71 in Mountain, where I have the image file for the tree uploaded in the tree or Evergreen class, so its one less thing that has to be iterated through when creating the list of trees in the biomes, and then the Evergreen/tree object is created and returns the Javafx Image. Other examples of this can be seen in the beginning of MainStage when the biomes are instantiated and ready to show everything it contains to the stage
D3: My abstract class is BiomeManager, which requires all its subclasses to have a grow() method, which are the biomes and they all override the grow method
D4: The class setupBiome is overridden using super in all the biomes around line 22, it creates an initial biome that is never seen but provides a default incase the other classed don’t have their own, and then is executed before all the trees are added in the subclasses with super.setupBiome()
D5a: As mentioned in D1, the functional interface of BiomeCallback is then called back to around line 111 in MainStage
D6:  My inner class is TreeGenerator on line 69 of Mountain, it is private and encapsulates the growOneTree() method which makes it private and unable to be accessed by other classes like MainStage, so growExtraTree() is created which returns an instance of treeGenerator running growOneTree publically
D7: My composition relationships are between the BiomeManager and the Biomes, as well as between the Biome and their respective tree objects. The forest Has-A tree while the BiomeManager Has-A forest, which is also explained at the top of MainStage
D8: My dependency relationship is between MainStage and BiomeManager, because for MainStage to work and be able to run and have anything to show, it needs the methods that and subclasses that BiomeManager is in charge of, like grow()
D9: My project simulates a biome being able to grow, but gives control to the user to determine specific factors in the biome
D10: My exception class and subsequent throws checks to make sure that images files are actually passed into the Image JavaFX object 
D11: If the image files isn’t correct, then a print statement is given in some cases with the stack, in others with just a message that the image wasn’t loaded, examples of this can be seen in Mountain, starting on line 40
F1: GUI reaction and input is the foundation of my programs so I have lots of buttons that cause the GUI to react, the button behavior starts on line 95 of MainStage
F2: The buttons add the tree images or switch between different panes 
F3: My different input I had was a mouse click that changes the background color to look like night or day which is on line 138 of MainStage
F4: The whole project is visual elements based on user entry
B3: For the bonus part I did a unit test class for the Mountain class which has 2 method tests, one to test whether the biome returns a group or not, as well as whether it contains elements (trees), and a method that tests whether it was successfully cleared or not, which failed and im not sure why because if I test it manually in JavaFX it works no problem
